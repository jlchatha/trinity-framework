# Trinity Framework - Persona Templates

Ready-to-use agent protocol templates for common use cases. Copy and customize for your project.

## Available Templates

| Template | Use Case | Best For |
|----------|----------|----------|
| [Solo Developer](solo-developer.md) | Individual projects | Personal projects, learning, solo work |
| [DevOps Engineer](devops-engineer.md) | Infrastructure automation | Cloud ops, CI/CD, deployments |
| [Team Lead](team-lead.md) | Multi-agent coordination | Managing multiple agents or teams |
| [OSS Contributor](oss-contributor.md) | Open source contributions | PR workflows, community projects |

## How to Use

1. **Choose a template** that matches your use case
2. **Copy the markdown block** inside the template file
3. **Paste into your AI interface** (Claude.ai Project Instructions, etc.)
4. **Customize the bracketed sections** with your project details
5. **Start a conversation** - your agent will follow the protocol

## Customization Tips

- **Agent Name**: Pick something memorable (ATLAS, FORGE, APEX, etc.)
- **Core Principles**: Add your working preferences
- **Decision Authority**: Define what the agent can decide vs. must ask about
- **Tech Stack**: List your actual technologies
- **Current State**: Keep this updated as your project progresses
